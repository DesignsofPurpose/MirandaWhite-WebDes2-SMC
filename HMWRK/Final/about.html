                            <p id="About">Located in the Leimert Park area of Los Angeles, the Savage Learning Environment is set up in our garage and extends into our backyard.  It is here where our family and neighbors enjoy learning together in joy and power.  Our learners are fearlessly jumping into deep conversations together, and we are vibing off of each other's questions, passions and thought-provoking ideas.  Each learner is shining in unique ways, we are paying attention to our emotions, we are resolving conflicts together, and we are laughing a lot as we grow in our critical reading, writing, and mathematical abilities.  Our doors are open, and we welcome more learners to join us.</p>
