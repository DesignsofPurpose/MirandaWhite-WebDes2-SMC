      <h3>Is unschooling legal in California?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Is Unschooling Legal? Unschooling is a form of homeschooling, and homeschooling is legal in all 50 states. And while there are no official “unschooling laws,” the laws that regulate how you homeschool in each state can affect the way you approach—or at least report—your homeschooling progress.
        </p>
        
        <p>Although home educated students spend an average of two to three hours doing formal homeschool hours per day, there are usually no requirements that make them do so. More often, hours should be highly dependant on a student's age. Counting hours is further complicated by what hours you count, and what hours you don't.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Does California pay for homeschooling?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          The state of California offers me, a homeschooling parent, $2600/year in educational funds for each of my kids. I, along with so many other homeschooling families in California, have crafted a customized and well-rounded education that reflects our family's interests, priorities, learning styles, and values.
