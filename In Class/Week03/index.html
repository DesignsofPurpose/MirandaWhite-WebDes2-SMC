            <p> For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will,
                the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far
                more valuable than those which divide us. It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was
                the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one
                eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn’t feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.
                Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for
                the next 10. </p>

                <p> We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but
                    because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and
                    skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone,
                    and one which we intend to win. There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both
                    figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one
                    makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>
